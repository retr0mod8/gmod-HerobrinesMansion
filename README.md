# gmod-HerobrinesMansion
Repository for cancelled map port of the classic Minecraft adventure map, Herobrine's Mansion. This was supposed to be released
on halloween, even if not fully complete, but that changed...

## Why is this unreleased?
Simple, VBSP has a limit of 65536 verticies for a map, and this map has too many verticies. I had hoped completely sealing the map would
removed the verticies for the areas between the mansion walls, but that failed and now all i'm left with is a 31mb VMF file (ironic cus halloween)
and 2 months of my life wasted.

## Future Plans
I hope to one day return to this map and potentially do some sort of dark ritual to revive it, or if VBSP gets an update to have a vertex count
bigger than 65536. I plan to port another Minecraft map soon in the future.
